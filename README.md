# top-hotdog

A silly take on the Hotdog/Not hotdog app featured in season 4 episode 4 of the show Silicon Valley. In this app, the user races to find and click on all of the hotdogs in a selected image. Once complete, the app records the user's time to completion and displays a high score list for the selected image.
